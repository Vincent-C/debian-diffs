debian-diffs
============

Contains Debian packaging files for packages maintained in my local repository
or PPAs, many of which are obsolete at this point in time. 

Ubuntu fonts:
There are 4 packages that are relevant for Debian users who want Ubuntu-like
font rendering:
 - freetype
 - fontconfig
 - cairo
 - libxft

libxft, cairo, and freetype are both currently identical in Debian and Ubuntu.
The only package that needs to be patched currently is fontconfig.
