debian-diffs
============

Contains Debian packaging files for packages maintained in my local repository

Ubuntu fonts:
There are 4 packages that are relevant for Debian users who want Ubuntu-like
font rendering:
 - freetype
 - fontconfig
 - cairo
 - libxft

libxft and cairo are both currently identical in Debian and Ubuntu. The only 
packages that need to be patched currently are freetype and fontconfig.
