borgbackup (1.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  - When upgrading from borg 1.0.x to 1.1.x, please note:
   - read all the compatibility notes for 1.1.0*, starting from 1.1.0b1.
   - borg might ask some security-related questions once after upgrading.
     You can answer them either manually or via environment variable.
     One known case is if you use unencrypted repositories, then it will ask
     about a unknown unencrypted repository one time.
   - your first backup with 1.1.x might be significantly slower (it might
     completely read, chunk, hash a lot files) - this is due to the
     --files-cache mode change (and happens every time you change mode).
     You can avoid the one-time slowdown by using the pre-1.1.0rc4-compatible
     mode (but that is less safe for detecting changed files than the default).
     See the --files-cache docs for details.
   - The deprecated --no-files-cache is not a global/common option any more,
     but only available for borg create (it is not needed for anything else).
     Use --files-cache=disabled instead of --no-files-cache.
   - The nodump flag ("do not backup this file") is not honoured any more by
     default because this functionality (esp. if it happened by error or
     unexpected) was rather confusing and unexplainable at first to users.
     If you want that "do not backup NODUMP-flagged files" behaviour, use:
     borg create --exclude-nodump ...

   - A borg server >= 1.1.0rc4 does not support borg clients 1.1.0b3-b5. #3033
   - The files cache is now controlled differently and has a new default mode:
     - the files cache now uses ctime by default for improved file change
       detection safety. You can still use mtime for more speed and less safety.
   - --ignore-inode is deprecated (use --files-cache=... without "inode")
   - --no-files-cache is deprecated (use --files-cache=disabled)

   - list: corrected mix-up of "isomtime" and "mtime" formats. Previously,
     "isomtime" was the default but produced a verbose human format,
     while "mtime" produced a ISO-8601-like format.
     The behaviours have been swapped (so "mtime" is human, "isomtime" is
     ISO-like), and the default is now "mtime".
     "isomtime" is now a real ISO-8601 format ("T" between date and time, not a
     space).
  - delete: removed short option for --cache-only
  - Running "borg init" via a "borg serve --append-only" server will *not*
    create an append-only repository anymore. Use "borg init --append-only" to
    initialize an append-only repository.
  - Repositories in the "repokey" and "repokey-blake2" modes with an empty
    passphrase
    are now treated as unencrypted repositories for security checks (e.g.
    BORG_UNKNOWN_UNENCRYPTED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK).
    Previously there would be no prompts nor messages if an unknown repository
    in one of these modes with an empty passphrase was encountered. This would
    allow an attacker to swap a repository, if one assumed that the lack of
    password prompts was due to a set BORG_PASSPHRASE.
    Since the "trick" does not work if BORG_PASSPHRASE is set, this does
    generally not affect scripts.
  - Repositories in the "authenticated" mode are now treated as the unencrypted
    repositories they are.
  - The client-side temporary repository cache now holds unencrypted data for
    better speed.
  - borg init: removed the short form of --append-only (-a).
  - borg upgrade: removed the short form of --inplace (-i).
  - BORG_HOSTNAME_IS_UNIQUE is now on by default.
  - removed --compression-from feature
  - recreate: add --recompress flag, unify --always-recompress and
    --recompress
  - init: the --encryption argument is mandatory now (there are several choices)
  - moved "borg migrate-to-repokey" to "borg key migrate-to-repokey".
  - "borg change-passphrase" is deprecated, use "borg key change-passphrase"
    instead.
  - the --exclude-if-present option now supports tagging a folder with any
    filesystem object type (file, folder, etc), instead of expecting only files
    as tags, #1999
  - the --keep-tag-files option has been deprecated in favor of the new
    --keep-exclude-tags, to account for the change mentioned above.
  - use lz4 compression by default, #2179
  - borg init: removed the default of "--encryption/-e", #1979
    This was done so users do a informed decision about -e mode.
  - See the upstream changelog for a list of the new features and bug fixes
