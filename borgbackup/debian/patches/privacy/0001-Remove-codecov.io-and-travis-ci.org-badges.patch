Subject: Remove online build services' badges

Lintian Tag: privacy-breach-generic

Reading the html docs would automatically open connections to their
servers in order to show the build status. While this may be of interest
when loading the github page, it's not relevant for the end-user reading
the docs.

Also, remove the link to the online docs of the 'stable' version, since
they could be out of sync with the Debian version.
