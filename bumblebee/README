Tarball: https://launchpad.net/~bumblebee/+archive/stable/+files/bumblebee_3.0.1.orig.tar.gz

Debian diff is based off of the work done by the Bumblebee Team in their PPA
(https://launchpad.net/~bumblebee/+archive/stable). A few changes were made in
order for the packages to be installable on Debian, e.g. changing the
dependency on nvidia-current (Ubuntu) -> nvidia-glx (Debian).

Post-installation instructions:
# usermod -a -G bumblebee $USER
