These patched cairo packages should be used in conjunction with the patched
freetype and fontconfig packages in this repo to provide a more comfortable
font rendering experience in Debian (at least, IMHO, fonts look better than
with Debian's default cairo/freetype/fontconfig packages).

Debian diff is based on the version in the main repository, with the following
patches:
- server_side_gradients.patch     (Ubuntu [1])
- cairo-respect-fontconfig.patch  (Arch Linux, AUR [2])
