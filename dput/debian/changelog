dput (0.9.2.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thanks to the offer from Thomas Viehmann, dput will now have two
    maintainers taking care of it.
  * Included a patch from Thomas Viehmann suppress error messages from
    dpkg which happened when the installed check was used. This will
    close the problem reported as #154960.
  * The option -o will now reliable simulate a normal run thanks to
    another patch from Thomas Viehmann. This will address the issue
    reported as #149711.
  * dput will now check the architecture in the installed packages
    check thanks to a patch from Thomas Viehmann. So the bug #154959
    will now also be solved.
  * Also dput will now not fail when trying to use a delayed directory,
    but instead report an error. And again thanks to Thomas Viehmann
    for the patch to solve the bug #182922.
  * Fixed bare debug statement that should have been caught earlier. This
    will now finally solve bug #133287.
  * Changed dependency on python to also include python 2.3 as requested by
    Robert Millan. He also verified that the basic functionality still works
    fine with the newer python version. So this will address the issue
    reported as bug #182800.

    (Closes: #98002)

    really such a archive is missing. (Closes: #89936)
