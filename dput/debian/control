Description: Debian package upload tool
 dput allows you to put one or more Debian packages into the archive.  This
 package also includes a dcut utility which can be used to generate and / or
 upload a commands file for the Debian FTP archive upload queue.
 .
 dput includes some tests to verify that the package is policy-compliant.
 It offers the possibility to run lintian before the upload. It can also
 run dinstall in dry-run-mode, when having used an appropriate upload method.
 This is very useful to see if the upload will pass dinstall sanity checks
 in the next run.
 .
 It is intended mainly for Debian maintainers only, although it can
 also be useful for people maintaining local apt repositories.
