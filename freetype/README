These patched freetype packages should be used in conjunction with the patched
cairo and fontconfig packages in this repo to provide a more comfortable
font rendering experience in Debian (at least, IMHO, fonts look better than
with Debian's default cairo/freetype/fontconfig packages).

Debian diff is based on the version in the main repository, with the following
patches imported from Ubuntu:
- debian/patches-freetype/revert_scalable_fonts_metric.patch:
  revert commit "Fix metrics on size request for scalable fonts.",
  which breaks gtk underlining markups (Closes: #636776, #636844)
