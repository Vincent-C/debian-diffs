Description: Powerful build system for the JVM
 Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for
 multi-language development. If you are building, testing, publishing, and
 deploying software on any platform, Gradle offers a flexible model that can
 support the entire development lifecycle from compiling and packaging code to
 publishing web sites. Gradle has been designed to support build automation
 across multiple languages and platforms including Java, Scala, Android, C/C++,
 and Groovy, and is closely integrated with development tools and continuous
 integration servers including Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Jenkins.
 .
 Gradle has an GUI interface by using "gradle --gui". If you want to use it,
 default-jre must be installed to provide GUI functionalities.
 .
 This package contains the binary Gradle distribution released by upstream.
