Tarball: http://www.freedesktop.org/software/vaapi/releases/gstreamer-vaapi/gstreamer-vaapi-0.5.3.tar.bz2

Based off of Ubuntu package, which can be found here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gstreamer-vaapi

This provides VAAPI-enabled gstreamer plugins, useful if your hardware supports it (e.g. Intel HD Graphics series - install i965-va-driver and vainfo packages, and run 'vainfo' to test).
