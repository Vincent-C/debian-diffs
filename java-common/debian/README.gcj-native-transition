default-jdk-builddep transition
===============================

default-jdk-builddep was a package to provide helpers to compile
class/jar files into native code, unfortunately its poorly chosen
name lead to people thinking it was the "Right Thing" to
Build-Depend on when maintaining a Java Package. This
misunderstanding even got into the templates for AMs for reviewing
New Maintainers (The T&SII follow up).

These helper tools requires a special Java Development Kit and
therefore on many architectures default-jdk-builddep would pull two
full JDK.

In order to end this confusion once and for all the Debian Java team
decided to rename default-jdk-builddep to gcj-native-helper and
reduce it to only pull the special JDK needed for native compilation.

The replacement for default-jdk-builddep falls into one of two cases.
If you create "gcj" packages (which contains jar files compiled into
native shared libraries), default-jdk-builddep should be replaced by
default-jdk AND gcj-native-helper. Otherwise you should replace it by
default-jdk.

If you are interested in the debate to do this rename, please have a
look at:
