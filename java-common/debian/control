Package: java-common
Architecture: all
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: default-jre, equivs
Description: Base of all Java packages
 This package must be installed in the system if a Java environment
 is desired. It covers useful information for Java users in
 Debian GNU/Linux, including:
  * The Java policy document which describes the layout of Java support in
    Debian and how Java packages should behave.
  * The Debian-Java-FAQ which provides information on the status of
    Java support in Debian, available compilers, virtual machines, Java
    programs and libraries as well as on legal issues.
  * Information on how to create dummy packages to fulfill java2
    requirements.

Package: default-jre
Architecture: any
Depends: default-jre-headless (= ${binary:Version}), ${jre}${jre:version},
 ${misc:Depends}
Provides: ${jre:provides}
Description: Standard Java or Java compatible Runtime
 This dependency package points to the Java runtime, or Java compatible
 runtime recommended for the ${jre:arch} architecture,
 which is ${jre} for ${jre:arch}.

Package: default-jre-headless
Architecture: any
Depends: ${jhl}${jre:version}, java-common, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: default-jre
Provides: ${jhl:provides}
Replaces: openjdk-6-jre-headless (<< 6b23~pre8-2~)
Description: Standard Java or Java compatible Runtime (headless)
 This package points to the Java runtime, or Java compatible
 runtime recommended for this architecture, which is
 ${jhl} for ${jre:arch}.
 .
 The package is used as dependency for packages not needing a
 graphical display during runtime.

Package: default-jdk
Architecture: any
Depends: default-jre (= ${binary:Version}), ${jdk}${jdk:version},
 ${misc:Depends}
Provides: ${jdk:provides}
Description: Standard Java or Java compatible Development Kit
 This dependency package points to the Java runtime, or Java compatible
 development kit recommended for this architecture, which is
 ${jdk} for ${jre:arch}.

Package: default-jdk-doc
Architecture: all
Section: doc
Depends: ${doc}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: default-jdk
Description: Standard Java or Java compatible Development Kit (documentation)
 This package points to the documentation for the Java development kit,
 or Java compatible development kit recommended for Debian, which is
 ${doc}.

Package: gcj-native-helper
Architecture: any
Depends: default-jdk (= ${binary:Version}), ${jdk:builddep}, ${misc:Depends}
Provides: default-jdk-builddep
Conflicts: default-jdk-builddep
Replaces: default-jdk-builddep
Description: Standard helper tools for creating gcj native packages
 This dependency package points to the build dependencies used to build
 gcj native packages.
 .
 Unlike default-jdk-builddep, this package only provides the
 helpers to compile jar/class files into native code and not
 a Java Development Kit (JDK). You do not need this package
 unless you are compiling jar/class files to native code.
 .
 Note: During the transition from default-jdk-builddep to
 gcj-native-helper, this package will also depend on
 default-jdk to avoid breakage.
