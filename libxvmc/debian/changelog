libxvmc (2:1.0.7-1+vc1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Multiarch-ify package based on Andreas' patch. (Closes: #640499)
    - This fixes M-A installation conflict when installing 32-bit Nvidia
      drivers, Google Earth, broken OpenGL acceleration when using Wine, etc.
      This really should be fixed in wheezy, but until it is, here's a fix.
