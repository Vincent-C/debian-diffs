Tarball: http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/linux-3.8.1.tar.xz

My own patchset can be found under debian/patches/vclaptop/; patches which are
applied are also listed in debian/patches/series.

This is a custom Linux kernel that I've built for personal use on my laptop.
In case you wish to use the same setup, here are some quick n' dirty
instructions (target audience is someone who is already familiar with Debian
packaging).

1) Download source tarball from kernel.org.
2) Download Liquorix debian diff (e.g. http://liquorix.net/debian/pool/main/
   l/linux-liquorix/linux-liquorix_$(VERSION).debian.tar.bz2). I use a
   3rd-party debian diff rather than the official debian diff in Debian's
   repositories to minimize the number of Debian-specific patches applied, and
   to not worry about all the other architectures supported by Debian (I only
   need a kernel built on amd64).
3) Use Debian kernel config as a base to work from (e.g. download
   linux-image-$(VERSION)-amd64, extract /boot/config-$(VERSION) from .deb).
4) Extract downloaded tarballs. Rename linux source tarball with source package
   name and orig, move debian/ dir inside linux source dir.
5) $ fakeroot debian/rules clean
6) Add any wanted patches under debian/patches/, and list in series file.
7) Drop kernel config into debian/config/kernelarch-x86; rename as
   "config-arch-64".
8) Edit debian/config/amd64/defines: "liquorix" to whatever name you want, in
   my case "vclaptop".
9) Edit debian/config/defines: change abiname, remove i386 from list of archs,
   change compiler version if wanted. Remove debian/config/i386/.
10) Edit debian/source/options: compression set to xz, compression level = 6.
    Edit debian/templates/control.source.in: change maintainer name and email.
    Edit debian/templates/control.image.type-plain.in: remove recommends for
    firmware-linux-free.
    Remove all references of liquorix from templates to avoid confusion.
    Edit debian/README.* with the following header:

Please note that everything below originates from the README file provided with
the Liquorix kernel; not everything applies to this custom-built kernel.

(README.Debian):

Major changes to my customized kernel compared with the stock Debian ones:
 - NOT optimized for size (CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=n)
 - compiled with -march=native (corei7-avx)
 - full preemption (CONFIG_PREEMPT=y et al.)
 - default I/O scheduler set to deadline (CONFIG_DEFAULT_DEADLINE=y)
 - always enable transparent hugepage (CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_ALWAYS=y)
 - enable MTRR sanitizer by default (CONFIG_MTRR_SANITIZER_ENABLE_DEFAULT=1)
 - kernel timer set to 300 Hz (CONFIG_HZ=300)
...and a number of other things.

11) $ dch -i (add changelog entry). I include the major config changes I've
    made to my kernel in README.debian instead of debian/changelog.

    Do not forget to change source package name and version if desired.

12) $ fakeroot debian/rules debian/control-real
13) $ debuild -jN    # where N = number of CPU cores
14) # dpkg -i *.deb  # or upload to personal repo and apt-get install
