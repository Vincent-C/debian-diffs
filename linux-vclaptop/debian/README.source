Updating the upstream source
============================

1) For creating the dfsg-pruned upstream source, the get-orig-source target
   of debian/rules can be used, it extracts the upstream version from 
   debian/changelog.

3) Unpack linux-liquorix-2.6-<version>.orig.tar.gz, cd into the new directory,
   and do a 'svn export' to get the debian/ subdirectory.

Applying patches to the liquorix kernel tree
==========================================

The liquorix kernel packaging uses Debian source format "3.0 quilt" as patching
system:

Patches are stored below debian/patches, loosely sorted in bugfix/,
features/, debian/, dfsg/ and upstream. Patches are in the standard kernel
patch format.

The order and the selection of patches which are applied during build
time is specified in debian/patches/series.

Kernel config files
===================
Configuration files are constructed dynamically from a number of config
files, as listed in debian/config/<arch>/defines.

Control file
============
The master control file debian/control must be generated before
the package is uploaded. debian/rules contains the debian/control 
target, which generates the control file by invoking the 
debian/bin/gencontrol.py script, which combines the templates from
the templates directory and architecture-specific defines file to
produce the debian/control file. Note that this target is intentionally
made to fail with a non-zero exit code to make sure that it is never
run during an automatic build. The following variables are substituted
into the templates:

@version@      Upstream kernel version, for example 2.6.11.
@major@        The major version, for example 2.6
@arch@         The Debian arch name, such as powerpc or i386.
@flavour@      The build flavour, such as 686 or k7-smp.
@class@        The CPU/architecture class; displayed in synopsis.  It should
               be fairly short, as the synopsis is supposed to be <80 chars.
               It should be in the form "foo class", and will show up in the
	       description as "foo class machines".
@longclass@    The CPU/architecture class; displayed in the extended
               description.  The same rules apply as in @class@.  If
	       this is unset, it will default to @class@.
@desc@         (Potentially) multi-line verbiage that's appended to
               -image descriptions.
@abiname@      Current abiname, a single digit.

Normally, the arch-specific contents should be controlled by
adjusting the corresponding defines file.
