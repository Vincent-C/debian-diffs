Description: pony re-implementation of cowsay
 Ponysay displays an image of a "My Little Pony" pony saying a message
 provided by the user in a terminal, or a quote from the show My Little
 Pony: Friendship is Magic (MLP:FiM). Historically ponysay was a
 wrapper for cowsay, but has since become an independent reimplementation
 of cowsay.
