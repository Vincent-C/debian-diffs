Description: pony re-implementation of cowsay
 Ponysay displays an image of a "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic"
 (MLP:FiM) pony saying a message provided by the user in a terminal. It can
 also be used in conjunction with fortunes (similarly to cowsay).
 Historically ponysay was a wrapper for cowsay, but has since become an
 independent reimplementation of cowsay.
