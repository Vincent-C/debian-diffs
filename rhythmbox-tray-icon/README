Tarball: https://github.com/palfrey/rhythmbox-tray-icon/tarball/master

This tray icon lets you run Rhythmbox even when its window is closed, with
gnome-shell (so you can "minimize" it to the notification tray, which was
perfectly possible with earlier Rhythmbox releases, without the need of an
additional addon).
