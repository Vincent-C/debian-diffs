soundconverter (1.5.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. This should fix the following bugs in Debian:
    - soundconverter stops converting m4a files sudently.. (Closes: #468846)
    - should depend on package gstreamer0.10-lame (Closes: #571521)
    - please support gnome audio profiles (Closes: #500239)
    - please package new version (Closes: #606764)
  * New Debian package maintainer. Thanks, Jason Heeris, for the previous
    uploads.
  * Removed debian/patches: the only patch is no longer required.
  * Removed debian/watch: it didn't work after upstream moved from
    Berlios, and I can't be bothered. (I would prefer watch files
    to be maintained in a central location, and not require packaging
    updates when upstream moves.)
  * Packaging re-done to use dh.
