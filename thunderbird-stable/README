Tarball: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/releases/45.5.0/linux-x86_64/en-US/thunderbird-45.5.0.tar.bz2

This package just installs the binary components of Mozilla Thunderbird
(en-US), built and distributed by upstream.

Renamed as thunderbird-stable instead of thunderbird to avoid conflicting with
another package in Debian.
