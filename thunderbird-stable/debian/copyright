This package was debianized by Fabien Tassin <fta@sofaraway.org> on 2008-02-25

The package was downloaded from http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/thunderbird/

EDIT: downloaded from CVS (until 3.0 is released) using the following commands:
   debian/rules get-orig-source (you need to install mozilla-devscripts >= 0.05)

The source tarball is an aggregate of several different works in which the
main one, developed by the Mozilla Project, is thunderbird.

The contents of the debian directory are licensed like the bulk of
thunderbird, tri-licensed under the GPL/LGPL/MPL.

The SVG files in the debian/logo directory are
Copyright 2006-2007 Ricardo Fern√°ndez Fuentes

Other works include gzip, bzip2, sqlite, libjpeg, libpng, cairo, and others.
Please see the sections following the copyright statements for thunderbird for
these.

If this file is incomplete, which I'm pretty sure is the case, because it's
difficult not to forget anything in this huge amount of data, please file
a bug or contact me.

Overall, the thunderbird project is licensed under the terms of the Mozilla

General Public License version 2 or subsequent, or the terms of the GNU
Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or subsequent.

The complete text of the Mozilla Public License can be found in the MPL file

Some of the files are also licensed (single, dual or tri) under the terms of
the Netscape Public License (NPL) which can be found as amendments to the
MPL at the end of the file. Please refer to http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/relicensing-faq.html

While the Mozilla Project is undergoing a global relicensing so that the
aim is to have a full tree with these tri-license terms, there are at the
moment quite some exceptions as following:

(Note that I sometimes assumed files not explicitly licensed to be licensed
under the same terms as the files around them and that a lot of the
information has been extracted automatically, thus maybe leaving some doubt.
Again, if you find "bugs", please contact me by email or via the BTS.)
