  * Dynamically load libnotify.so.4 (instead of libnotify.so.1, which is
    no longer in sid) when sending notifications to the system tray, for

     + debian/control: recommend libnotify4 instead of libnotify1

    A better fix would be to link against libnotify, but Bart Martens prefers
    to delay this until Jessie (it will be a larger diff).

    removed Depends on python and tcl, we're using Recommends instead.
    This change was requested by a lot of people, I think this is the best
    way to do it without creating a new package just for plugins.
    Note that plugins are still loaded on start because I don't want
    to block this feature, users without python or tcl can safely ignore
    the brief warning they'll get, I added a note about it into README.Debian.

    Try to use alias.pl (/usr/share/doc/xchat-common/scripts-perl/alias.pl)
  * Sorry, I prefer to use conflicts between xchat and xchat-gnome packages

  * Ircd doesn't support PRIVMSG #chan1,#chan2; closes: #100757.
  * Upstream author's words:

    or create a patch.. the plugin interface is very rarely used (and not
    changed in 1+ years).

xchat (1.6.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "Hints" to menu files; closes: #82317.
  * Now actions cause a beep for PM windows (if you enable it).
    Patch provided by Richard Fuchs <dfx@gmx.at>; closes: #78484.
  * After a discussion with upstream author I've decided to remove
    panel applet support from xchat-gnome package; Peter said that
    "it's not really a maintained piece of code" and I think that it's
    useless to provide a broken applet (of course if someone would like
    to take care of code I'll readd it.) closes: #82113, #84723, #84729.
  * Now messaging channels or nicknames works a bit like in mIRC now,
    i.e. when there's an open tab for the destination, the message shows
    up there (usefull for logs); closes: #60104.
    Patch provided by Richard Fuchs <dfx@gmx.at>.
  * Peter's words:
    "<zed> #69765 - with the suggested solution the client could be too
    easily fooled by people having some fun :) xchat doesnt "handle"
    netsplits anyway, it just prints out what the server says."
    "<zed> the netsplit message is no different to a quitmessage unluckily".
    closes: #69765.
  * Peter dixit: "thats the way it is", it's not a bug but, a feature.
    closes: #78494.

xchat (1.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.(closes: #81031, #79674).
  * xchat-gnome: now built with --enable-panel.
  * Added zh_CN and zh_TW.Big5 po files; thanks to Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>.
  * Upstream author said that all GTK+ apps do this and he can't fix them;
    closes: #79647, #81385.
  * That perl script isn't included into xchat upstream tarball and we don't know
    what it should do, submitter doesn't provide any other info, so we can close
    it; closes: #79641.
  * xchat doesn't come with a en_DK po, anyway it should ignore it; I tried to
    export en_DK and I used xchat 1.6.3 both with and without libc6-i686:
    it works. closes: #78710.

    some changes; closes: #59904.
  * Socks4 support works, just use "Proxy server" menu; closes: #72952. 
  * Only previous version was affected by this; closes: #78007.
  * Docs troubles are fixed; closes: #78008, #78230.

  * Fix xchat, xchat-gnome and xchat-text to have symlinks from
    /usr/doc/$pkg to /usr/share/doc/$pkg. Note that /usr/share/doc/$pkg

  * New upstream release.
  * #56285 is a GTK problem. (Closes: #56285)
  * Bigger topic buffer (in src/fe-gtk/chanlist.c). 
    (Closes: #37018,#52955).
  * Hopefully deals with #60826. I'll close this in the next revision if
    it does.
  * Includes patch for text.c (Closes: #60719)
  * Includes patch for fkeys.c (Closes: #58957).
  * Problem with unexpected /nick behaviour fixed. (Closes: #53623)
  * Unfortunately, to resolve #47343, I would need release n+1 versions
    for each language. In the meantime, it's possible to override the
    English autocomplete words by doing Settings -> Replace Popup - Delete 
    All. In the meantime, I'm going to close this bug. If you feel the
    need to dicuss it further, don't hesitate mailing me. (Closes: #47343)
  * Adam Klein split xchat{-gnome,-text} into xchat-common, xchat,
    xchat-gnome, and xchat-text. This deals with #43760. (Closes: #43760)
  * /recon now remembers what server to reconnect to. (Closes: #58050)
  * After thinking long and hard about it (well, not really) I have come
    to the conclusion that Joey Hess' proposed description is much more
    appropriate. I've therefore decided to include it. (Closes: #61815)

    release, so I'm going to close it. If you notice it again, please
    reopen it. (Closes: #59116)
  * As fair as I can tell, these bugs are still open:
    Important: #60826 - Discussion is taking place between the reporter of
    this bug (joeyh@varesearch.com) and Adam Klein, who kindly did a NMU
    release when I was unable to. Many thanks to Adam :)

    #60181 - this one will probably be closed quite soon. I'm still
    thinking about whether or not to remove python support, or have an
    xchat-thelot (or whatever) package that has gnome+python+perl+text+*.
