Tarball: http://xorg.freedesktop.org/releases/individual/driver/xf86-video-intel-2.20.12.tar.gz

Aside from being rebuilt against the current Xorg version in Debian wheezy
rather than experimental, SNA acceleration is compiled and enabled by default
(./configure flags: --enable-sna --with-default-accel=sna). This renders
xorg.conf unnecessary for usage of SNA acceleration.

Additionally, a number of power-saving options are enabled by default in
/etc/modprobe.d/i915-kms.conf: i915_enable_fbc=1 i915_enable_rc6=1
lvds_downclock=1).

The acceleration method is still switchable at runtime with a xorg.conf
snippet, if you wish to use the older UXA, e.g.:

$ cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf
Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Intel Graphics"
    Driver      "intel"
    Option      "AccelMethod"  "uxa"
EndSection
