Aside from being rebuilt against the current Xorg version in Debian wheezy
rather than experimental, SNA acceleration is compiled and enabled by default
(./configure flags: --enable-sna --with-default-accel=sna). This renders
xorg.conf unnecessary for usage of SNA acceleration.

(Additionally, a number of power-saving options are enabled by default in
/etc/modprobe.d/i915-kms.conf: i915_enable_fbc=1 i915_enable_rc6=1
lvds_downclock=1).)
The above is no longer true in my packaging since these options will automatically be enabled if your hardware works well with them, e.g. Ivy Bridge comes with i915_enable_fbc=1 and i915_enable_rc6=3 from linux >= 3.4. Forcing these options may cause stability issues.

The acceleration method is still switchable at runtime with a xorg.conf
snippet, if you wish to use the older UXA, e.g.:

$ cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf
Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Intel Graphics"
    Driver      "intel"
    Option      "AccelMethod"  "uxa"
EndSection


Changelog:
2.20.9 -> 2.20.12:
Fix for a regression introduced in 2.20.10, i.e. fix component-alpha rendering
on IvyBridge, for example subpixel antialiased glyphs.
